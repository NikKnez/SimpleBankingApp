Simple Banking Application for practice

Simple Banking Application

The Simple Banking Application is a command-line Java program that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing, withdrawing, and checking their account balance. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the banking system and manage their account conveniently.

Features:

Deposit: Users can deposit a specified amount into their account. The application ensures that only positive amounts can be deposited, preventing invalid inputs.

Withdraw: Account holders can withdraw funds from their balance, provided they have sufficient funds. The application checks for valid withdrawal amounts and insufficiency of funds before processing the transaction.

Check Balance: Users can inquire about their current account balance, which is updated in real-time after every transaction.

Menu-Based Interface: The application presents a simple menu to the users, allowing them to choose the desired banking operation by entering the corresponding choice number.

Graceful Exit: Users can easily exit the application by selecting the appropriate option from the menu.

How to Use:

Run the Main class to start the application.
The main menu will display the available options: Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, and Exit.
Enter the desired option number from the menu and follow the on-screen instructions.
For deposit and withdrawal, enter the amount you wish to deposit or withdraw.
The application will process the transaction and display the updated account balance.
Note:

The application enforces the usage of positive amounts for deposit and withdrawal to ensure the validity of transactions.
For withdrawals, the account must have sufficient balance to proceed with the transaction.
If an invalid option is selected, the application will prompt the user to try again.
The application keeps track of the account balance throughout the session.
